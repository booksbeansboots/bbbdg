> We live our lives in cycles, travelling through endings to new beginnings. Each cycle leads us one step closer to the truth of who we are.

**[Live Life Gently â€“ Change the World](https://booksbeansboots.co.uk/llgindex/)**Â is the Essence Map that leads us back to ourself, our truth, our essence.

With the message that our most challenging life experiences have the potential to be transformational, Live Life Gently shows us where we are now and how to take the next steps. We can look back on our pivotal moments to see how these have led us to where we are now.

If youâ€™re ready to reconnect, reboot and realign, Live Life Gently will help you to figure out how to do just that.

### Change your world, change the world

There is a path that we walk through life. When we understand the purpose of the challenges, milestones and pivotal moments along the way, we begin to see ourselves and our truth more clearly.

When we start to change, we have the potential to change the world around us.

The framework for Live Life Gently is the Essence Map â€“ a series of milestones, starting with an Ending and leading to a realignment with our essence. Iâ€™ve experienced each of these many times throughout my life. It has been these experiences that enabled me to see the journey that we each travel, the cyclical nature of our life paths, and the lessons we learn.

It is our losses that teach us the most, and enable us to see who we truly are.
