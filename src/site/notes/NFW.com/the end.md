> What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from ~ TS Eliot

We are naturally programmed to dislike change. We prefer the comfort of life as we know it. Despite challenges which inevitably appear, our default setting is to maintain the status quo.

We will cling to our normal lives for as long as we can.

But change is inevitable. If we are to grow, our lives are underpinned by change. It catapults us to the next phase of our life.

Endings are typically connected with loss of some sort. The loss of a job, the loss of a loved one, a relationship or, a way of life.

Endings can be shocking. Depending on the circumstances, they can shake us to our core. They can impact our physical body as well as our mental state.

But endings catapult us to a new place, somewhere weâ€™re meant to be for our personal growth, and set off a chain of events that lead us forward.
