Every reader on Substack who kept me accountable as I attempted to share the book in serialised format.

To everyone who spurred me on, encouraged me with their feedback and kind words.

To my subscribers who signed up to travel on this journey with me. Thank you Janet Winter and Sarah Kennedy for being the first.

To Andy Marshall who 'got' Essence and always reminds me of mine.

To Todd Brison who told me I was a good writer.

To Chris who has always believed in me, and saw my Essence from the beginning.
