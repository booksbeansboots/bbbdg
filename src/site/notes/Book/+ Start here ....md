*Guiding you back to your essence through the pivotal moments and milestones on your journey*

![](https://source.unsplash.com/hopX_jpVtRM/1900x1200)

**Live Life Gently ~ How to Change Your World** is a non-fiction book based on my explorations of the past decade or so. Focusing on the cycle of change that I call the Essence Map, this book takes the reader on a journey through the ebbs and flows of life, the potential found in pivotal moments, and the role that change plays in bringing us back to our essential self.

This book is being written and compiled using a tool called [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/), a notetaking app, which also has a publish function.

> Become who you truly are and you can change the world

## Dedication

For everyone who believes there must be more to life.

May you have the courage to go in search of your truth. 

To Chris, who saw me from the inside out from the very beginning.
