It's in human nature to fear change. 

Refer to a study about change.

I didn't like change at all in my twenties. I preferred the status quo and did all I could to maintain that. I hated job hunting with a passion yet for the next 10 years or so, I spent a lot of my time moving from job to job. Redundancies were a factor, the death of a boss, and the internet bubble bursting.

#quotes 

Condition yourself for chaos and change every day
Stop anticipating things to go back to normal
The only thing normal is change and evolution must be established
Only the strong will survive

>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. Bruce Lee
