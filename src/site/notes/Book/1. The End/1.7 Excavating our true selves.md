## Excavating our true selves

Over time part of us goes underground. Living Life Gently is the start of excavating that.

We carry on as normal but there comes a point when something starts to niggle at us. We suspect, deep down, that we have more to offer but we donâ€™t know how to find out what that is. 

We hear others talking about purpose and wish we could find ours. 

We get older and believe itâ€™s too late. Itâ€™s never too late.

We are more than just our physical bodies. There is some greater energy to which we are all connected and of which we are a part. Whatever you want to call this energy, (some call it God, the Divine, the Soul, or, as I like to, the Source), it is an organising force, present throughout the Universe, and we are made of the same stuff.
