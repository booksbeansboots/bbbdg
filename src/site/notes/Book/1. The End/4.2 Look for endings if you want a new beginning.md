Itâ€™s 8 years today since my Mum died. Every year I relive those last couple of days and marvel at how an ending, however sad, can be the catalyst for an entirely new chapter.

My Mumâ€™s death was a pivotal moment which changed my life out of all recognition. 8 years ago I was single, living on my own, working in Manchester with no thought of a different future. 

Today, Iâ€™m married and living one of my dreams in Derbyshire, building up a small business of my own and several other ventures. 

I talk about the Essence Map, a life journey that I documented before Iâ€™d heard of the Heroâ€™s Journey. Itâ€™s premise is our endings herald new beginnings. We shouldnâ€™t fear change because itâ€™s designed to take us where we need to be. 

Looking back to 8 years ago I can clearly see the milestones that mark the route Iâ€™ve taken since my Mum died. Out of something that we naturally deem to be traumatic came a whole new life.
