Back in the day blogging was novel. It was mostly an anonymised activity. You chose a domain name - mine was vanillasky as I've always been nuts about vanilla, there was a film out by the same name but the makers hadn't bought the domain, so I did. For the record, I've never seen the film. 

We kept ourselves under wraps for the first few years. Then started to come out of the blogging closet. Those early days were bliss. There was an innocence and naivety to our blogging. 

My blog was quirky random jottings about my day to day. Part diary, part observation, there was no set theme. I loved being online and publishing my posts to a minuscule audience. I blogged mostly for me and just because I could. 

Publishing online with Obsidian and a return to the tiny web harks back to the good old days. It's almost as if we have come full circle. 

We've been distracted by Twitter and then Instagram. Now, they are losing, or already have lost, their appeal. That love affair is over. But, what next? Despite trying Mastodon, it's still very close to Twitter and doesn't give that warm fuzzy feeling that a favourite blog did. 

Perhaps we want control over the content we consume again. I certainly don't want to see stuff that doesn't interest or appeal to me. That includes television - we stopped watching years ago and ceased buying a TV Licence. I don't miss any of it. I don't watch the news either. 

We need to create and curate our own content. Find our niche. Discover what lights us up. Not only is this good for our soul, it's good for the world. As more and more people unsubscribe from the doom merchants we increase the sum of human happiness.
