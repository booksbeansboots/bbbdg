## writing

When I quit my day job in April 2019 in a bid to forge my own path, I came across someone who seemed to be doing exactly what I dreamed of. They had created a writing life. We spoke and then I went off in a different direction because I didn't think I should copy what she was doing.

For almost three more years, I did a range of other things. I was a self-employed Business Advisor, website creator, eCourse host. I talked a lot about living at a gentler pace and my Essence Map. The latter never really gained any traction.

In April 2021 I first came across [[Books Beans Boots/obsidian|Obsidian]]. It transformed my view of writing. An evolution had taken place. [[Books Beans Boots/writing|Writing]] was no longer in the style encouraged by my English teacher at school. There was a new way. Digital and online writing. 

As I explored, first [[Books Beans Boots/pkm|PKM]] and then Second Brain, took part in Ship 30 for 30, wrote atomic essays, made lists, and re-joined Medium, a realisation began to dawn. Perhaps I could be a writer.

There were signs of encouragement. Kind words, positive comments. Unsolicited emails about a post or article. And then, income on Medium. All of these spurred me on and made me double down on my efforts.

Then, one day, I decided I had to go all in with my writing. So I did.

I write in Obsidian, both privately and in public. You can also find me on Medium and Substack. I like to write a daily [[Books Beans Boots/log|log]], and share writing logs for my Substack subscribers.
