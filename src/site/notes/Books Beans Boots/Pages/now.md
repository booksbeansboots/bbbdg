## ðŸŒ³ now

What I'm doing now ... 

## shifting

As my writing becomes my side hustle for a while, I find myself evolving in new directions. 

My Instagram has become a private space for friends and family with fairly regular Stories and a once a week Round Up.

I've regrouped on Substack. 

## writing

I'm going back to basics and prioritising my book. Inspired by Nicole Gulotta, I've reworked my website and the layout of Live Life Gently - Change the World. Nicole talks about Writing Seasons and, while a different premise to The Essence Map, made me realise I could rework the map milestones.

## audio

I love audio and this is becoming part of my Substack output. And possibly for my Twitter Circle.

## obsidian

I am still a huge fan of Obsidian. That, too, is undergoing a refresh, especially my published Digital Garden. I'm still contemplating what this looks like in this new phase of my life.
