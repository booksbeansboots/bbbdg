## ðŸŒ³ about me

I'm Nicola. A Writer, Photographer, Podcaster, Geek.

I live in a small village in the Peak Park area of Derbyshire with my husband.

Iâ€™m an INFP. Iâ€™m unconventional, quirky, an introvert and live outside the circle. That might make me eccentric!

I have an eclectic range of interests.

## writing

I write about the intersection between tech and [living at a gentler pace](https://booksbeansboots.co.uk/nfwstart/). I'm exploring the premise that, if more of us lived a gentle life, reconnected to who we truly are, or our essence, as I call it, we could change the world for the better.
