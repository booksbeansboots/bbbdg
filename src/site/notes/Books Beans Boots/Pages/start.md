## live life gently

*Our lives follow seasons and cycles. Endings herald new beginnings. Pivotal moments lead us to our truth. We walk a path that is laid out for us. We just need the map.*

We can change the world when we live life gently.

### there is a path that we walk on the journey home.

The Essence Map is our guide through the ebb and flow of life. It leads us to our truth, to our very essence. If we have a sense that there is something more, something as yet untapped, the Essence Map will help us uncover who we truly are.
