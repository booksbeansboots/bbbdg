## ðŸŒ± life

In 1984/85, I lived in Paris and studied at the Sorbonne. One of my enduring memories is [[Books Beans Boots/Life/meeting|meeting]] [[Books Beans Boots/Life/bill|Bill]] Murray. Ghostbusters was just out - I saw it in English with French subtitles - and Bill had recently filmed The [[Books Beans Boots/Life/razor|Razor]]'s Edge, which I watched in a cinema on the Champs ElysÃ©es.

These days, I write a lot about living life at a gentler pace. Inspired by a photographer I know, I started to create my own [[Books Beans Boots/Life/credo|credo]].
