## ðŸŒ³ now

What I'm doing now ... 

## gardening

Although I love the full bloom of Summer, I prefer the cooler Autumn days. I like tidying up the garden, pruning the potted plants and prepping the borders for Winter. The beauty of a partly potted garden is that it's a moveable feast. I clustered all the pots that were still in flower near the house so that they can catch the last rays of the sun.

## writing

Although I'm writing a lot less, I'm enjoying it more. I've significantly pared back my plan giving myself one task a day. I'm using Otter and audio more which is easy to squeeze into a free five minutes here and there.

## obsidian

I've given my Obsidian setup a refresh. I migrated my [digital garden](https://booksbeansboots.co.uk) from Markbase (which is very good) to the plugin Digital Garden (which I like too). I archived all my notes and am now pulling them out of their folder one at a time. They're all being reviewed, tidied up and backlinked together in a much more effective and Wiki-like way.
