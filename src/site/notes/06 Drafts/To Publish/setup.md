## new obsidian setup

Its been a while! Life etc took over. In the background, I've been reorganising Obsidian. It's been through a few different iterations.

Digital Garden

At first glance I wasn't that keen on Digital Garden. There was no sidebar menu, graph or other features you can find in Obsidian Publish. 

It needs more linking up but that's what a digital garden is all about. 

I moved my notes into a temporary directory. And started processing them, one by one. After I edited each note, I linked them to the intro text or added them to the index. It started to make sense. 

I'm still doing this and it's going to take time but, once I'm finished, everything will be connected in a tiny web/early days of blogging kind of way. 

What I like about Digital Garden is that I can update the theme quickly and easily and create a whole new look. 

I've set up some shortcuts. CTRL-M now publishes all my new notes. CTRL-. publishes the current note. 

Digital Garden has made me think more about the structure of my notes and process them in a different way. 

I keep my digital garden in a folder. I like the organisation. I can see what's in and what's not. Technically, you can add:

dg-publish: true
dg-permalink: "setup"

to the YAML and Digital Garden will publish any note from your vault. I just prefer to create my own separation. 

I've kept things as simple as possible. My note template is pared down. 

I use icons in the title to denote:

ðŸŒ±Â _seedling_:Â drafts and new ideas
ðŸŒ¿Â _budding_:Â ideas that have been developed, writing that's been edited
ðŸŒ³Â _evergreen_:Â published or completed writing

Initially I added back links to index pages, planning to add new notes but decided this was too time consuming. I also included creation dates and last updated but abandoned that too. 

Issues

Digital Garden, like Maxime, runs on Netlify and GitHub. Don't let this put you off as it's easy to setup. 

I had a couple of failed updates and a long page of debugging text. I realised I only needed to look for a file name. Failure to publish was due to already having a file of the same name, and easy to resolve.
